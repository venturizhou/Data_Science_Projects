Federal Student Loan Data

Introduction
Talk about increasing costs of student loans over time
For example, the older generation could work a summer jobâ€¦ pay for college and have money left over
Now students have to borrow large amounts of money to pay for college (public universities)
And additional amounts, students usually do private bank loans (not shown in data) or Parent PLUS Loans (making parents borrow money too)
Some parents do not cosign loans
Private school $$$
College $$ inflation

Objective (Thoughts)
Which states are more expensive
How has the borrowing amount changed over time (per state, per major)?
Analyze the amounts that grad students have to borrow
What variables can we use to predict the amount that a student will borrow 
We can split this into undergraduate and graduate
General Analysis

Other Consideration that would have helped
Having data broken down by race, age, gender
